# Case Study #5 - Data Mart

## Problem Statement

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer. Danny needs help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and itâ€™s separate business areas.

There is only one key dataset, which is represented by the table below.

## Case Study Questions

### Data Cleansing Steps

```sql
TEMPORARY TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS
    (SELECT STR_TO_DATE(week_date, "%d/%m/%Y")        AS "week_date",
            WEEK(STR_TO_DATE(week_date, "%d/%m/%Y")
                )                                     AS "week_number",
            MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(week_date, "%d/%m/%Y")) AS "month_number",
            YEAR(STR_TO_DATE(week_date, "%d/%m/%Y"))  AS "calendar_year",
            region,
            platform,
            CASE
                WHEN (segment LIKE "%1%") = TRUE THEN "Young Adults"
                WHEN (segment LIKE "%2%") = TRUE THEN "Middle Aged"
                WHEN (segment LIKE "%3%" OR segment LIKE "%4%") = TRUE THEN "Retirees"
                ELSE "unknown" END                    AS "age_band",
            CASE
                WHEN (segment LIKE "%C%") = TRUE THEN "Couples"
                WHEN (segment LIKE "%F%") = TRUE THEN "Families"
                ELSE "unknown" END                    AS "demographic",
            customer_type,
            transactions,
            ROUND(sales / transactions, 2)            AS "avg_transaction",
            sales
     FROM weekly_sales);
```

### Data Exploration

### 1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(DAYNAME(week_date)) AS "Day of the week"
FROM clean_weekly_sales;
```

|Day of the week|
|-----|
|Monday|

***

### 2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_table(Number) AS (SELECT 1
                                     UNION ALL

                                     FROM cte_table
                                     WHERE Number < 52)
SELECT DISTINCT(cte.Number)
FROM cte_table cte
LEFT OUTER JOIN clean_weekly_sales c ON cte.Number = c.week_number

### Before & After Analysis

### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

```sql
