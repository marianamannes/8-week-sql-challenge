# Case Study #6 - Clique Bait

## Problem Statement

Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry. In this case study it was required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

There are five key datasets, which are represented by the relationshop diagram below.

## Case Study Questions

### Digital Analysis

### 1. How many users are there?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS "Users"
FROM users;
```

|Users|
|-----|
|500|

***

### 2. How many cookies does each user have on average?

```sql
WITH cte_table AS (SELECT user_id,
                          COUNT(cookie_id) AS count_cookie
                   FROM users
                   GROUP BY user_id)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(count_cookie), 1) AS "Avg cookies"
FROM cte_table;
```

|Avg cookies|
|-----|
|3.6|

***

### 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?

```sql
SELECT MONTH(event_time)          AS "Month",
       COUNT(DISTINCT (visit_id)) AS "Visits"
FROM events
GROUP BY MONTH(event_time);
```

|Month|Visits|
|-----|-----|
|1|876|
|2|1488|
|3|916|
|4|248|
|5|36|

***

### 4. What is the number of events for each event type?

```sql
SELECT ei.event_name       AS "Event name",
       COUNT(e.event_type) AS "Events"

INNER JOIN events e ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
GROUP BY ei.event_name;
```
|Event name|Events|
